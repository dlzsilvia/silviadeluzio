I am a business analyst at [Sidea Group](https://sideagroup.com), and a computer engineering student at [Politecnico di Bari](https://www.poliba.it), in Italy.

I am currently working on several projects across different sectors, such as luxury fashion, and corporate welfare. My main area of operation is billing and accounting, with a special focus on subscription-based services. I also plan to expand and delve more and more into the data management world, connecting the dots between modern fashion needs and the advanced tech tools available today.

From an academic perspective, I have a technical background in computer engineering, exploring fields like algorithms and data structures, software engineering, web development, databases, operating systems, networking, and control systems. I am now focusing on key software development tasks, such as functional analysis and testing. Also, I like to work with API, in the interaction between logic and data retrieval and management.
