I am a business analyst at [Sidea Group](https://sideagroup.com), and a Computer Engineering student at [Politecnico di Bari](https://www.poliba.it), in Italy.

I am currently working on several projects across different sectors, such as luxury fashion, and corporate welfare. My main area of operation is billing and accounting, with a special focus on subscription-based services. I also plan to expand and delve more and more into the data science world, connecting the dots between modern fashion needs and the advanced tech tools available today.

From an academic perspective, I have a technical background in Computer Engineering, exploring fields like algorithms and data structures, software engineering, web development, databases, operating systems, networking and control systems. I am now starting to focus on AI applications in the fashion space, like fashion recommendation engines and algorithms.
